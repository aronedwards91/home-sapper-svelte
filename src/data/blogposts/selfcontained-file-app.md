A little blog post on how you can create self-contained React HTML apps. Why?, the reason I went into it was for portability, a single html file can be run on any OS right from the HDD, or even hosted on a website for people to access.

Another advantage, which I'll show a build method for later is the ability for a form app to spit out it's own html app file.

For reference, the app I created these tools for is a Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA), links [here](https://portal-jumper.onrender.com/)
